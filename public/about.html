<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hi, I’m Anil Suva! <br />
  I am currently pursuing my graduation at GEC, Bhavnagar, and I am a 4th-semester IT engineering 
  student. I consider myself a good problem-solver and team player. I am also a quick learner 
  and always eager to explore new things</p>
</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I have a strong passion for video editing and cinematography. I am a 
  professional in video editing and love shooting cinematic visuals. I also enjoy watching anime 
  and movies. My favorite anime is Attack on Titan, and my favorite movie is Avengers: Endgame—I’ve 
  watched it multiple times!
</p>

<p>In addition, I play a lot of games. I have accounts in almost every game you can name! I excel 
  at PUBG and Call of Duty. Although I haven’t played Black Myth: Wukong yet, I plan to dive 
  into it in the future.
